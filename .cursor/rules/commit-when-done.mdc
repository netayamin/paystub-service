# Commit and push when done

When we finish building a feature or completing a task:

1. **Decide when it's done** — You decide when the work is complete (feature implemented, tests/docs updated if needed, no known broken state).
2. **Commit and push** — Stage all relevant changes, commit with a clear message, and push to the remote (e.g. `origin main`).

Do this without being asked. The user prefers that completed work is committed and pushed as part of wrapping up.

If the user explicitly says not to commit (e.g. "don't push yet"), skip the commit/push.
